    <h1>HTML, CSS and The DOM</h1>

    <div>
        <h3>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTML AND CSS</h3>

        <p>HTML is like the skeleton of a dog’s body. CSS is what distinguishes the dog from another visually. The
            colour
            and texture of their fur, the shape of their teeth, what their collar looks like and other features. Adding
            JavaScript to this- would be the dogs brain, coming up with logical decisions, chewing, chasing and whether
            or
            not it’s a good idea to eat the neighbour’s cat’s shit.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h3>

        <p>Control flow refers to the order in which a program executes or evaluates a set of given statements and
            instructions. I’m wanting my Vogel’s to be toasted to my perfect toasty-ness. If the toast pops and does not
            meet my required toasty-ness I’ll pop it down again.</p>

       <img src="control-flow.png" alt="example of control flow" class="c-flowimg">

        <p>Loop statements allow us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times until the given
            condition
            is met. Think of it when learning to ride a bike. You get on your bike for the first time, start to peddle
            and
            fall off, jump back on and try again, fall off and again you get back on and try again until you finally are
            able to ride down the street without falling off.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>THE DOM</h3>

        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an object oriented representation of a web page made up of nodes such as
            elements, attributes and text content and represents the document as a tree structure. It allows the
            developer
            methods for adding and removing nodes, moving them to different locations in the tree, or modifying their
            contents.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>ARRAY VS. OBJECTS</h3>
        <p>An array is a data collection of a single variable of a similar type. Arrays start counting from 0. In the
            example below “tomato” would be [1] and “sardines” would be [3]. Items can be modified with using push(),
            pop(), shift(), unshift() methods.</p>

            <img src="array.png" alt="example of an array" class="arrayimg">


            <p>Objects on the other hand are made up of a “thing” that can have many characteristics. These characteristic
            are
            called properties that consist of a key and a value. Properties can be modified by using dot or bracket
            notations.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>FUNCTIONS AND THEIR USE</h3>
        <p>A function is a set of code designed to perform a certain task when it is called. It must be defined first in
            the
            scope before calling it. You’re able to pass a value to the function and it will return a value. By having a
            function you are able to write a set of instructions once rather than writing it every time you want the
            program
            to do something.</p>
