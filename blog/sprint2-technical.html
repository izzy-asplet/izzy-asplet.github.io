    <h4 class="diffhead">The Difference Between</h4>
    <h1>Margins, Borders and Padding</h1>

    <p>As we know every element in HTML is wrapped inside a box. In CSS, the term “box model” is used when we talk
        about the design and layout. It contains of four main properties; margins, borders, padding and the content.
    </p>
    <p>Let's have a look</p>

    <div>

    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Padding</strong> – Refers to the space between an element’s content and any defined margins and/or borders. The
        properties used for setting the margin for each side of the element are: top, right, bottom, and left. There
        is also an auto property which will horizontally centre the element equally between the left and right
        margins. Padding properties allow you to have length or percentage values.
        You would use padding for spacing within an element.
    </p>

</div>
    <p><strong>Border</strong> – Is the line between the box’s padding and margin. You’re able to set CSS border properties to
        change the style, width and colour of an element’s border. They can all have from one or four values. top,
        right, bottom, and left.
        The border-style property allows you to specify the borders “looks” like having a dotted border, dashed
        border and there are many more options to choose from.
        The border-width property allows you to specify the borders size. They can be chosen individually for each
        value or by one of the three pre-defined values thin, medium, and thick.
        The border-color property is self-explanatory.. I hope.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Margin</strong> – Creates empty space between the box and surrounding boxes. Margins have properties for each side of
        the element: top, right, bottom, and left.
        You are able to specify the margins for each side separately in CSS. Just like padding, the margin
        properties can have the same values of length and percentage. But unlike padding they can also hold a
        negative value.
        Use margin for spacing between an element.
