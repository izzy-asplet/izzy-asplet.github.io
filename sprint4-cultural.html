    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>

    <p>Neuroplasticity can be considered as learning. It is the understanding of how empowering your brain can become
        one of your most beneficial assets. It is and how we can create new connections between neurons and rewire brain
        function. When people stop learning or practicing new things the brain will start to lose these connecting cells
        that formed that pathway. Like learning a new language, you may start off practicing every day for two weeks but
        stop after that. Your brain might lose these connections once stopped because it is no longer considered useful
        “use it or lose it”.
    </p>
    <p>A great example of “use it and improve it” is people who are dealing with a brain injury, they need to relearn
        how to adapt and recover through repetition and intensity of doing something over and over again until your
        brain can recognise and retrieve these actions as second nature.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Growth Mindset?</h3>

    <p>
        Having a growth mindset refers to the belief that you can improve intelligence as opposed to having a fixed
        mindset. Again like neuroplasticity, it’s the understanding that your brain is one of your most powerful assets.
        People with growth mind sets usually embrace opportunities without the fear of failure, as they understand that
        trying and sometimes failing is a part of learning process. They believe new abilities can be created through
        practice, and that constructive criticism is not personal but related to how they can improve on what they are
        getting assessed on.
    </p>

    <h3>How can it help me?</h3>

    <p>
        To help with my learning journey I will harness the realisation that my brain is constantly changing and can
        change with practice, it will helps eliminate those feelings of giving up because I’m not smart enough.
        Embracing others’ achievements, seeing peers succeed and solving problems despite the obstacles that stand in my
        way.
