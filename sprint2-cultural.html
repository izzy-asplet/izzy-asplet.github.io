    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <h3>goals and career path</h3>
    <p>My long term goal is to be in a career where I can grow and improve my skills and knowledge. Eventually I would
        like to be in a position where I can work from home, but also start a family. I’m unsure of what pathway I would
        like to dive into because I’m still unsure of where my strengths lie.
    </p>

    <h3>skill development</h3>
    <p>I would love for myself to gain more confidence in what am trying to achieve. Communicating when I need help and
        learn to take constructive criticism as a positive. Networking with other developers as I heard it’s all about
        who you know as much as it is about what you know.
        As being someone who likes to try and figure things out for myself, I know once I’ve taken the fear away of
        being judged I feel I could improve my skill set faster by asking for opinions and help when I get stuck, before
        deciding to shut down and give up.
    </p>

    <h3>commitments and expectations</h3>
