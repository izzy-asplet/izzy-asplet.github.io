    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <h2>Ethical decision </h2>

    <p>When I was high school my friends and I would often go to parties in the weekend. Walking to the gatherings was
        always the fun part, to me it was like an adventure, a mission. Other times we would get a lift with friends or
        take the bus or a taxi, but they were always costly back then (no such thing as Uber). There was one time when a
        friend came to pick us up and he had clearly had a few beers beforehand and probably still on his learners.. I
        remember feeling extremely uncomfortable sitting in the back while we sped along to the party exceeding the
        speed limit. Knowing very well that the driver was not totally sober. After that drop off I told myself I would
        never get into a car with someone I did not find fit to drive. It could have been a fatal situation, not only
        for us in the car, but someone else on the road too.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural influence</h2>

    <p>Growing up in Wellington I was exposed to the huge melting pot of cultures around me. Every day being exposed to
        so many different nationalities, cultures and beliefs gave me an understanding of how to be accepting,
        respectful and considerate of others no matter their background.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>

    <p>My main strengths in the work place are being approachable, open minded, creative and empathetic.
    </p>
    <p>My limitations are definitely having a fear of being judged also being too self-critical, this leads me to not
        try new things, indecisiveness, not being patient, foucusing too much on the small details and not communicating
        when I need help.
