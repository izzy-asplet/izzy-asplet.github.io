    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice, evaluate and express your own emotions and the emotions of
        others. It’s the understanding of how to use actions to help influence your thinking and adaptability in
        different situations and environments.</p>

    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

    <p>EI differs from IQ as it is not based on an individual’s score on a set of standardised tests designed to assess
        intelligence. EQ can always be improved with practice and will no doubt give you an edge on becoming more
        successful in leadership roles, teamwork and collaborations in the workplace. On a personal level it is a way of
        reaching a higher level of happiness and purpose, less stress and the ability to over-come life’s challenges.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    
    <p>Emotional Intelligence is extremely important in both the workplace an in your personal life. People who exhibit
        high levels of EI are more empathetic, co-operative, can build authentic and more satisfying relationships and
        have greater social skills.</p>
